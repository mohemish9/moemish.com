# sonic-game
“Sonic the Hedgehog” minigame. Sonic must reach the end while avoiding enemies and bombs and collecting rings to go faster. The user can move Sonic from side to side with a set speed for the character. The camera will follow Sonic as he advances through the stage. The camera can still be adjusted depending on how the user wants it to be. There will be bombs that will be moving side to side and if Sonic collides with one of them, he will have to restart from the very beginning and his velocity will be reset to the initial value. There will also be a few enemies who will move around randomly across the “board”. The enemies will be undergoing spherical collisions between themselves and the bombs. However the bombs will keep moving linearly. If Sonic collides with an enemy, he will lose rings and be pushed back (spherical collision). Sonic, the enemies, the rings, and the bombs will all be undergoing linear collisions with the “walls” of the “board”. The goal of the game is to reach the endpoint to clear the level. Once the level is cleared the, the program will print a statement saying the user finished, how long it took to clear the level, and the number of rings the player collected.  Directions: -Use the left and right arrow keys to move Sonic from side to side -Use mouse to set the camera angle you want -Avoid enemies and bombs -Collect coins to get a speed boost (speed x1.25) -Reach the end target which will be a pyramid with a big ring on top of it
