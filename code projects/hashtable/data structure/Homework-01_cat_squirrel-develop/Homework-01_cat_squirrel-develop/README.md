# Homework 1

# Overview
In this assignment, you'll get your first chance to look at (and use!) pieces of the C++ standard library. As you will see in the Issues, this assignment includes both written and coding parts. 

To get the starter code, you will first need the git path of your repository; you can do so by clicking the green "Clone or Download" button and copying the url that appears. Then, you should check out the `develop` branch of your assignment repository to your work space. In Homework 0, you did so using two separate commands: 

```
git clone <path_to_your_repo>
git checkout develop
```

Note: This task (cloning a repository and switching branches) is so common, there's actually a way to do it in one command:

`git clone -b develop <path_to_your_repo>` 


# Reading
Before you begin, you should look at the following readings:
* Chapter 1 through Section 1.4 and Sections 3.1-3.2 of the *C++ Primer, 5th Edition*. These are available on Piazza or on reserve at the Honnold Library.
* Documentation on [Strings in C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string)
* The introduction (up to "Organization") to the [C++ Input/Output Library](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iolibrary/)
* The HW1 tab of the Piazza Q&A page, where we will collectively accumulate clarifications and useful advice for the assignment. You should  check this before you start the assignment, and may want to check back periodically (especially if you're having trouble with something in the assignment).

Note that you will also be finding a lot of your own online resources as you complete this assignment. It's a good idea to keep track of these in one place so that you can refer to them later.

# Completing the assignment
Just like in HW0, you should complete this assignment by completing the issues in numerical order. To get started, follow the "Issues" tab at the top of this page.

# Grading
Your submission will be graded as follows: 
* 20 points: correctness
* 20 points: completeness
* 10 points: clarity 

The written portion of the homework is worth 20 of these 50 points.  

See the [Grading Guidelines](https://cs.hmc.edu/cs70/wiki/Grading-Guidelines) wiki page for more information about what we're looking for in each of those categories. 

# Resources 
* See the *[GitHub How To](https://cs.hmc.edu/cs70/wiki/Setting-Up-Your-Repository) wiki page* for details on how to set up this assignment. 
* Help each other out! If you have resources or tips for other teams, add them to the appropriate Piazza tab for this assignment. 

# Helpful Hints
* *Pair Programming:* Remember, you must work on coding and writing tests as a pair.  You can (and should) read this assignment writeup and think about it before you meet, however.
* *Commit Early, Commit Often:* Remember to check in your files regularly!  In particular, don't forget to check them in when you're finished.
* As a general rule (even outside CS 70!), *you should not add generated files* of any form (e.g., compiled code, PDFs made from LaTeX, etc) to a repository when those files can be automatically produced from files already in the repository.
