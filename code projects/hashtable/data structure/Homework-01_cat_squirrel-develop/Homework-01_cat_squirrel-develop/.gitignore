# Sometimes there are files you do not want to check in to GitHub.
# In particular, generated files such as object files (.o extension),
# exectubales (with a .out extension) and files the OS will generate
# such as the dreaded .DS_Store or ._* files.
# We cannot ignore extensionless files to catch all binaries, since then
# we'd be ignoring Makefiles as well.

# Ignore .out files
*.out

# Ignore object files
*.o

# Ignore OS generated files
.DS_*
._*

# Ignore temporary files from editors
