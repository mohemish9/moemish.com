# Overview
In this assignment, you'll implement a singly-linked list class that is similar to classes in the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). Your list class will also define an iterator, so that users of the class can iterate over all the elements of the list.

After you've implemented your list, you'll analyze its performance for a number of different operations.

# Reading
**These readings are important. Be sure to look at them before you start and as you work.** 

In addition to the class wiki notes, you should look through the following before starting this assignment:
* C++ Primer Ch. 3.4 on Iterators (see link on Piazza)
* The [documentation for C++'s iterators](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iterator/)
* Some [information about `nullptr`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/nullptr). When we want to explicitly say that a pointer points nowhere (e.g., when initializing a pointer data member as in the `IntList` constructor), we use `nullptr`.
* The [specifications](Specifications.md) for your `IntList` and `IntList::Iterator` classes. **This document describes the interface of the data structures that you'll be implementing.**.

# Grading
Your submission will be graded as follows: 
* 20 points: correctness
* 6 points: completeness
* 4 points: style 
* 5 points: elegance
* 5 points: clarity 

See the [Grading Guidelines](https://cs.hmc.edu/cs70/wiki/Grading-Guidelines) wiki page for more information about what we're looking for in each of those categories.
