# Homework 2

# Overview
In this assignment, you will build on your understanding of good C++ coding practices in two key ways:

* Reason about appropriate code style and elegance
* Organize code into separate files to support *separate compilation* 

You'll also get a chance to practice converting *code* to *summations*, and comparing theoretical results to empirical ones. 

After practicing separate compilation as part of the written exercises, you'll apply it in your coding exercise this week. 

# Reading
There's no required reading this week, but you may find it useful to review some of the ways you can analytically evaluate summations using tools like Wolfram Alpha:

* [Wolfram Sums and Products](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/SumsAndProducts.html)
* [Wolfram Summations of Series](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/SummationOfSeries.html)

You should also keep an eye on `hw2` posts on Piazza, which may include useful clarifications or hints. 


# Grading
Your submission will be graded as follows:
* 20 points: correctness
* 15 points: completeness
* 5 points: style
* 5 points: elegance
* 5 points: clarity

The written portion of the homework is worth 20 of these 50 points.

See the [Grading Guidelines](https://cs.hmc.edu/courses/2018/fall/cs70/wiki/Grading-Guidelines) wiki page for more information about what we're looking for in each of those categories.

We'll grade each of the categories and provide you itemized feedback.

# Helpful Hints
* *Pair Programming:* Remember, your must do your coding work as a pair. 
You can (and should) read this assignment writeup and think about it before you meet, however.
* *Commit Early, Commit Often:* Remember to add and commit your files regularly!
In particular, don't forget to push them to Github when you're finished.
* Keep in mind that, starting with this assignment, your code will be evaluated for style and elegance. 
* As a general rule (even outside CS 70!), **you should not add compiled code to the repository** (executable programs or `.o` object files). That would be redundant (since compiled code can bee automatically generated from the source files that *are* in the repository), and then you'd just have a lot more bits (i.e., machine language for all versions of your source code) being stored on disk and transferred between computers.
