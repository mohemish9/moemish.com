        "This assignment is to predict housing prices. We're using a dataset from Ames, Iowa ([paper](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf), [dataset](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock/AmesHousing.txt)).\n",
        "\n",
        "You may find it useful to start with the [Chollet notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/nrhodes/cs152fa2019/blob/master/Lecture_12_3_7_predicting_house_prices_(tf_2_0).ipynb) that does regression on Boston housing prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook currently loads in the Ames housing dataset into a [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) dataframe ([Pandas cheatsheet](https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)). Pandas is a Python library suited for working with large amounts of tabular data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your goal is to train a Neural Network to a low Mean Absolute Error on your validation dataset (that is, you want to minimize the average error in predicted house price).  Since the number of samples is fairly small, I recommend using some form of K-fold cross-validation. \n",
        "\n",
        "In order to ensure that the K-fold cross-validation error is accurate, ensure that you don't make the mistake that the Chollet notebook does of doing a one-time normalization of the data  and then splitting it up into training and validation.  Instead, when you do normalization, it should be based on the mean and standard deviation of *only* the data the model is being trained on (otherwise, information from the validation data has *leaked* to the training data).\n",
        "\n",
        "You'll need to decide:\n",
        "*  The structure of the Neural Network (number of layers and sizes)\n",
        "*  The number of epochs\n",
        "*  The choice of _k_ for k-fold validation\n",
        "*  The optimizer to use\n",
        "*  The activation functions to use\n",
        "* The value of hyperparameters\n",
        "*  Whether you want to remove uniquely-identifying information from the training instances (e.g., each training instance has a unique _Order_ and _PID_ field)\n",
        "*  How you want to deal with categorical information ( [this article](https://pbpython.com/categorical-encoding.html) gives some possibilities).\n",
        "*  Whether you want to create any new columns (based on existing columns)\n",
        "* Whether you want to remove any columns\n",
        "* Whether you want to add any regularization\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Please keep a log in your notebook, keeping track of what you've tried and what its results are.\n",
        "\n",
        "I'll be grading this assignment on:\n",
        "*  Whether you've fixed the leaking validation error (w.r.t. normalization).\n",
        "*  The effort/creativity you've shown in attempting to create a good model (as shown in the log).\n",
        "*  The MAE you've achieved on the validation data.\n",
        "* How clear your notebook is. Don't just have code cells, have text cells that describe what's going on. However, don't just copy the text cells from the Aggarwal notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "I expect that you'll spend between 10 and 20 hours on this assignment.\n"
