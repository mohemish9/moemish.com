prompt: When engines suggest surprising moves, or arrangements of pieces that look "ugly" to human sensibilities, they are often seeing more deeply into the game than their users. Starting from this point, consider one or two areas other than chess in which our aesthetic intuition may be limiting our success unnecessarily. Or is it necessarily?
Response: I think computers are going to take over humans in the fields that require evaluation and strategy, such as military leadership, legal services, structural design and writing code. Currently, human innovation is the main factor of progress in these fields as well as others; however, this can be replaced by higher-functioning algorithms that runs on more advanced processors, makes not errors, runs at an unparalleled speed, and needs no rest. The rate of satisfaction of costumers will be higher since these computers make no mistakes. Concerns about losing jobs can be overcame by applying higher taxes on firms that uses these computer (thus pay not fees for labor) and redistributed to those how lost their jobs in form of a universal basic income.
