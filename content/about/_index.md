Hi! My name is Mo Emish, a Software Engineer seeking full-time position. I am skilled various Data Engineering and Data Science tools and equipped with PM-oriented teamwork skills.

During my last two years, I performed serval data ELT processes and worked in data science projects with multiple stakeholders. My motivation came from a strong aptitude for translating complex processes into smaller steps and automating them using robust implementation. I also trained ML models, collected and analyzed BI and UI insights and architected different solutions on AWS.
